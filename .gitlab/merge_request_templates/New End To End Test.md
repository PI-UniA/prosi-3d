### Check-list

- [ ] Confirm the test has a [`testcase:` tag linking to an existing test case](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/end_to_end/best_practices.html#link-a-test-to-its-test-case-issue) in the test case project.
- [ ] Note if the test is intended to run in specific scenarios. If a scenario is new, add a link to the MR that adds the new scenario.
- [ ] Follow the end-to-end tests [style guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/end_to_end/style_guide.html) and [best practices](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/end_to_end/best_practices.html).
- [ ] Use the appropriate [RSpec metadata tag(s)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/end_to_end/rspec_metadata_tests.html#rspec-metadata-for-end-to-end-tests).
- [ ] Ensure that a created resource is removed after test execution.
- [ ] Ensure that no [transient bugs](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#transient-bugs) are hidden accidentally due to the usage of `waits` and `reloads`.
- [ ] Verify the tags to ensure it runs on the desired test environments.
- [ ] If this MR has a dependency on another MR, such as a GitLab QA MR, specify the order in which the MRs should be merged.
- [ ] (If applicable) Create a follow-up issue to document [the special setup](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/end_to_end/running_tests_that_require_special_setup.html) necessary to run the test: ISSUE_LINK
